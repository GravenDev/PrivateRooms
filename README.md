## Host it yourself
The PrivateRooms bot is a publicly available bot but can be hosted on your own server.
It's not that complicated, but it needs few steps to get it to work.

### 0. Prerequisites
Check your JDK version :
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```
Both should be "Java 18".

### 1. Build the project
Run this command : 
```bash
gradlew shadowJar
```
If all went well, the executable jar file should be in the `build/libs` directory.

### 2. First launch
Before launching the bot first, you have the copy `languages/` folder in you jar folder.
Then launch the jar file, this might create a `config.toml` configuration file containing this :
```toml
token = "TOKEN HERE"

[database] # The database must be a postgresql database
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
username = "postgres"
password = "postgres"
database = "postgres"
```
Fill the configuration file with your contents and relaunch the jar file. The bot should start and 
allow you to use it!
