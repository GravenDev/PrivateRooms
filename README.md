## Host it yourself
The PrivateRooms bot is a publicly available bot but can be hosted on your own server.
It's not that complicated, but it needs few steps to get it to work.

### 0. Prerequisites
Check your JDK version :
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```
Both should be "Java 17".

### 1. Build the project
Run this command :
```bash
gradlew shadowJar
```
If all went well, the executable jar file should be in the `build/libs` directory.

### 2. First launch
Before launching the bot first, you have the copy `languages/` folder in you jar folder.
Then launch the jar file, this might create a `config.json` configuration file containing this :
```json
{
  "token": "TOKEN HERE",
  "dbHost": "localhost",
  "dbPort": 5432,
  "dbUser": "postgres",
  "dbPassword": "postgres",
  "dbName": "postgres"
}
```
Fill the configuration file with your contents and relaunch the jar file. The bot should start and
allow you to use it!
